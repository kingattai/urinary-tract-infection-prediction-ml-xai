Urinary Tract Infection(UTI) Diagnosis Using Machine Learning and Explainable AI (XAI)
This project leverages machine learning models (XGBoost, Random Forest, and Decision Tree) alongside LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to diagnose UTI based on patient symptoms and risk factors. It aims to provide accurate predictions and transparent model interpretability, especially useful for healthcare professionals in resource-limited settings.

## Objectives
- Diagnose UTI using supervised machine learning algorithms.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
- Apply LIME to explain model predictions and enhance transparency.
- Aid clinical decision-making through interpretable AI systems.
